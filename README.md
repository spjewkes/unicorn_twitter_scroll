# Unicorn Twitter Scroller

This was a mash-up of the examples found in:
* [scroll-phat-hd](https://github.com/pimoroni/scroll-phat-hd/blob/master/examples/twitter-hashtag.py)
* [unicorn-hat-hd](https://github.com/pimoroni/unicorn-hat-hd/blob/master/examples/text.py)

I've tried to improve it by separating out some of the options as either a configuration file or arguments.

I would recommend using the font OpenSansEmoji which seems capable of showing some emojis in the scroller.

You will need to modify the default configuration with your Twitter API credentials to get this working.
